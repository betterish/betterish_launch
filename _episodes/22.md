Has someone ever told you that you couldn't do something, and it only made you want you want to do it more? Kate Hamill knows that feeling. She's a playwright who started writing because she was pissed there were no shows for her to act in, and now her plays are some of the most produced in the country. In our conversation, we talk about how she turned that initial impulse to say, "F you!" and turn it into great art.
