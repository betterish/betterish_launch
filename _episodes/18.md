What do you do when you realize that you trust yourself, more than your community? When Angella Johnson was 19 years old, she left the Mormon Church and has spent her life trying to define what it means to be "a good person" without the structure that defined that for her growing up. She tells us how she does that and how she's trying to create a, "life without explanation."

Part 1 of 4 episodes on the role of faith, having it or not, on how we think about getting better at things.
