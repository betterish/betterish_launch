What would happen if you just unfollowed the things that made you feel bad? In a world with millions of social media options, it's becoming more important to be judicious in what you consume. People often audit their diets, but have you ever logged what social media you consume and how it makes you feel? Kat Zdan began doing just that about a year ago, and it turns out the answer is not so simple. She explores the pros and cons of controlling your social media feeds in this open conversation about the impact that they have had on her life and self-image.
