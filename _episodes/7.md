Dr. Heather Patrick has designed some of the largest behavior change studies in history. We sit down to talk about why some people seem to achieve their New Year's goals and others struggle. She blows Coach Stevo's mind with a cool new behavior change tool called "practice quitting" and opens up about her own struggle to "find her tribe."
