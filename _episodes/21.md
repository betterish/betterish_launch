Yusuf took the name Yusuf when converted to Islam when he was 20. But it's taken him 20 years to live up to that name. We discuss the challenges of finding guidance in sacred texts that aren't in English, and how navigating a new religion as a convert prepared him for changing careers and starting a new business.
