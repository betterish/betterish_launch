Imagine giving up your entire life to pursue something, then right after you've made the plunge, becoming so paralyzed with fear that you couldn't perform at even the most basic level. Andrus Nichols experienced that at the age of 30 when she left her life to become an actor. We learn how over the next 3 years, Andrus became unstuck by creating her own graduate school curriculum and filling 18 moleskines to create her own "user manual."
