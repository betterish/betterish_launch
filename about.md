Stevo, Vanessa, and Omar started [Habitry, the coaching education company](http://habitry.com) in 2014, with the mission to, “help the most people help the most people.”

But a lot of the work felt like it was paving over poor foundations. We began to notice that before our work with people even started, there was something weird about the way that most people think about getting better at things— an implied subtext to how “getting better at stuff” is sold and taught.

Somehow, a false idea got implanted into most people's heads that we should try to learn and master new things because we are not good enough the way we are. That wanting to get “better” at something implies that one is currently “broken.” But this is patently untrue.

<blockquote>Just because you want to improve, does not mean you are broken.</blockquote>

- There is no “perfect you” that is waiting to be uncovered.
- There is no “skinny you” that you need to sweat out.
- There is no “adult you” that will have life figured out.
- There is no “future you” that will finally be worthy of love.

Because you already enough. And being curious about what you are capable of does not mean you are incapable of doing great things and bringing great joy to the world now.

Not only is this unspoken myth not true, it’s not even useful.

According to Motivation Science, people are more successful on their self-improvement journeys when we set out on the journey mostly for it’s own sake. Not when we are bullied or shamed into starting with marketing that implies, or overtly tells us, that if we don’t improve we will forever be a failure.

You cannot hate yourself into becoming a better person, but clever people can certainly use this myth to sell us shit.

Tired of being a part of a story that we think is setting back our entire mission, we created betterish to tell a new story. The story of how people _actually_ get better at things. To get the message out that you are not broken. You have nothing to atone for and we are not selling magic beans or hair shirts. We simply want to tell true stories of people getting better at things, and make a place where the curious can explore— free from judgement.

## What we’re making
Right now, we make a weekly podcast, the [bettercast](/bettercast), dedicated to real stories of people who got better at things. These are not your typical self-improvement journeys, precisely because they are real. Each episode is dedicated to a conversation with a real person about what getting better at things really looks like.

In addition, we post to instagram. [@betterish_co](http://instagram.com/betterish_co) is a bite-sized, visual alternative to the bettercast and an antidote to the curated performances typical of instagram.

## What we’re selling
We have no fucking clue. We actually don't even know if it's possible to make money at this yet, because every book, blog post, and MBA will tell you that the easiest way to get people to buy shit is to remind them they are inadequate or broken. We hope to figure an alternative to that with you as we get to know more about what kind of things you want to get better at and the problems you’re having with getting better at them.

## What this is
Betterish is a work in progress, wholly devoted to the process of progress. We’re dedicated to showing you the preparation stages. To learning loudly and in public. And to building the whole business with you, right in front of your eyes. We don’t know what that is yet, but we also know we don’t want to default to the status quo that makes people feel broken. Or other. Or ugly. Or unloveable.

Because you’re none of those things. And wanting to be better at something doesn’t mean you have to hate who you are. It just means you’re curious about how much better you can be.

Or you know, betterish.
